### To keep track my patch
1. Scroll-back. I did not patch incremental, instead just modified the source my self.
2. Vim mode (Maybe buggy, its kind of outdated)
3. Colorscheme (dracula + some custmozation, didn't do patch, modify source instead)
4. Sync. (Better rendering, but st render still break sometimes with nerd symbol.)
